    <h1>Smart Home Automation Using Google Assisstant</h1>
    <p> Home automation has rapidly evolved with advancements in Internet of Things
        (IoT) technology, enabling users to control household appliances remotely using
        smartphones, voice commands, and automation systems. This project, Smart Home
        Automation using Google Voice Assistant and Switches, aims to create a cost- effective and
        user-friendly automation system that integrates NodeMCU ESP8266, relays, Arduino
        Cloud, and Google Home Assistant to control various electrical loads. The system provides
        multiple ways to operate home appliances, ensuring both convenience and flexibility by
        supporting manual switches, mobile applications, and voice commands via Google
        Assistant. By integrating both AC and DC loads such as a DC pump, an AC pump, an AC
        bulb, an AC fan, and a DC motor, this project enhances home automation for various
        applications, including lighting, climate control, and irrigation systems.</p>
